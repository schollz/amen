# amen

there are two modes: *maker* to record loops and *breaker* to play loops with effects.

### maker mode

- e1 zooms into loop start
- e2 jogs loop window
- e3 changes loop length
- k2 starts/stops recording
- k3 starts/stops playback of loop
- k1 switches to *breaker mode* using the current loop.

_note:_ you can also enter *breaker mode* by loading a file via the parameters (`AMEN > load file`). make sure the file you load has `bpmX` in the name, where `X` is the bpm of the file.

### breaker mode

- e1 switches effects
- e2 changes loop start (unquantized)
- e3 changes loop end (quantized)
- k2 activates left effect
- k3 activates right effect
- k1 switches back to *maker mode* using the current loop
